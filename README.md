# efficient-programmer

This is a repo to keep track of my progress. I do not follow the pomodoro technique exactly, although I do follow a loose-version of the pomodoro technique.

1. Every night before I go to sleep, I list out the programming task I need to complete (with predicted duration). Each task usually will take around 20-45 mins depending on the task. Anything bigger will have to be broken down into smaller task. 

2. I divide my day into sections between which I have long-breaks (1 hour). Each section consists of several task between which I have short-breaks (5/10 mins). I try to stay on the same genre of task in each section so that I do not have to deal with the intertia of changing genres. 

3. In the spirit of good programming practice, I allocate a my final task in a section to refactor the code I have written.

4. Some of these task require that I need to learn and understand new concepts, for example, learning a new framework. These are great vacuums of productivity. Hence, any learning will not be included and occur at my own time.
