# efficient-programmer

## Description 

This is a repo including my daily todo lists. I do not follow the pomodoro technique exactly, although I do follow a loose-version of the pomodoro technique. 

Every night before I go to sleep, I list out the programming task I need to complete (with predicted duration). By referring to that list, I make a realistic schedule of what tasks I should do the next day. The schedule looks something like this:

-- Morning -- 

Section 1 
- [x] task1
- [x] task2
- [x] task3
- [ ] refactor

-- Afternoon --

Section 2 
- [ ] task4
- [ ] refactor

Section 3 
- [ ] task5
- [ ] task6
- [ ] refactor 

-- Evening --

Section 4 
- [ ] task7

-- End -- 


## Rules 

#### What is a task?

Each task usually will take around 20-45 mins depending on the task. Anything bigger will have to be broken down into smaller task. 

#### What is a section?

I divide my day into sections between which I have long-breaks (1 hour). Each section consists of several task between which I have short-breaks (5/10 mins). I try to stay on the same genre of task in each section so that I do not have to deal with the intertia of changing genres. 

#### Refactor Code

In the spirit of good programming practice, I allocate a my final task in a section to refactor the code I have written.

#### Learning

Some of these task require that I need to learn and understand new concepts, for example, learning a new framework. These are great vacuums of productivity. Hence, any learning will not be included and occur at my own time. 

#### Preparation 

Firstly, always always always think about solving your problems outside of the allocated schedule time. Encourage yourself to peek at your code even before you approach it. Secondly, always think about updating your master list with task.
